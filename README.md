# Investigating inequality

Material for a workshop on investigating inequality using health data. See [slides here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/investigatinginequality/blob/main/Investigating%20inequalities%20in%20health%20MJA.pdf)

Key points: 

1. Consider different angles (don’t just look for relationships)
2. Combine data to identify potential inequalities
3. Identify the risks (and manage them)


## 1. Consider different angles

The [7 common angles for data stories](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/08/11/here-are-the-7-types-of-stories-most-often-found-in-data/) provides a framework to generate ideas for stories around inequality:

* Reveal the **scale** of inequality
* Change: reveal how much inequality has **risen or fallen** - or the fact that it has **failed to improve** despite initiatives
* Ranking: reveal which areas or categories rank **worst or best** for inequality. Or reveal which demographic groups experience the poorest treatment/results.
* Reveal that **variation** exists
* Reveal a **relationship** between outcomes and another measure (warning: correlation is not causation - see risks)
* Reveal a **lack of data**, or **concerns over data quality**, or **make data newly accessible**
* **Explore** an issues through a number of different angles, e.g. the scale of the issue, how much it's changed, where it's worst, etc.

News story ideas will reveal a primary facet of an issue, but may add a secondary facet later in the story (e.g. the headline is about the scale of the issue, but later you detail how much it's changed). Adding a third facet risks losing the focus, and you may be better using a feature format to do that.

Feature story ideas will explore an issue through more than two facets, but can use the same angle twice (e.g. these are the worst areas for one aspect, these are the worst for another, and these are the best).

## 2. Combine data to identify potential inequalities

[See the workshop on using XLOOKUP](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/investigatinginequality/blob/main/docs/xlookup.md)

## 3. Identify the risks (and manage them)

- Data tells you what is happening, but not why - ask an expert
- Correlation vs causation: other factors, e.g. housing, social class, age profile
- Watch out for [p-hacking](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.220346) (aka [data dredging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging))
- Smaller groups are underrepresented in the data = more variation
- [Communicating the quality of ethnicity data](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/communicating-the-quality-of-ethnicity-data/)
- Tendency to group non-white groups into single ‘BME’
- Communicating uncertainty (e.g. margins of error)
- Data doesn’t show the lived experience - case studies needed
